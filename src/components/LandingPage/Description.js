        <br />
        <p><b>Channapatna</b> is a small town on the <b>Bangalore- Mysore highway</b> which has a long and unique
        <b> handicraft tradition of lac-turnery</b>. The locally available <b>soft wood</b> known as <b>‘hale’</b> in Kannada
        (writia tinctoria is the botanical name) is turned on a lathe into circular shapes and while being
        turned is given a coating of a  mix of resin lac and vegetable dyes. To spread the lac evenly,
        the craftsmen hold a screw pine leaf against the wood as it turns. The leaf’s nonadhesive
         and heat resistance nature, gives the wood a glossy finish.
         <b>Toys and dolls, gift articles, home decorations, kitchen accessories </b> are produced in this manner.
</p>
        <p>    The craft is said to have <b>originated in Persia</b> and promoted by successive rulers of Mysore.
          Bavasmia, the Superintendent of the Government Industrial School at Channapatna visualizing a good future for the craft,
          is credited with introducing the craft as a subject of study in the Industrial School.
        Local artisans began to practice the craft as a full time vocation.
